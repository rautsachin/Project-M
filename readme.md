# 🚀 Project-M: Explore the Moon in 3D 🌕  

Welcome to **Project-M**, an interactive web project that lets users explore the Moon in **3D**! This project was built as part of my **Three.js Bootcamp**, where I learned how to work with 3D models, export them as `.glb` files, and use **Model Viewer** to render them on a website.  

## 🌍 Live Demo
